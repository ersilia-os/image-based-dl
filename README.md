<!-- Exploitation of the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) dataset on the activity of putative antimalarial compounds in asexual blood stages of the Plasmodium Falciparum parasite. Usage of the [MolMap](https://github.com/shenwanxiang/bidd-molmap) library as a DL model for predicting the activity of the molecules against the pathogen that causes Malaria.

## Installation

1. Install the necessary pip and conda packages from my environment:
    - Download the ```environment.yml``` and create the environment from this file: ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
    - Activate the new environment: ```conda activate molmap```
    - Verify that the new environment was installed correctly: ```conda env list```

If you see 'molmap' on your environments list, you can proceed with the next step. 


2. Install [Griddify](https://github.com/ersilia-os/griddify):
```
git clone https://github.com/ersilia-os/griddify.git
cd griddify
pip install -e .
```

3. Install [Ondisk-xy](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ondisk-xy):
```
git clone https://github.com/ersilia-os/ondisk-xy.git
cd ondisk-xy
pip install -e .
```

4. If you want to manage the files (placed on folder 'files') as [Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/), it may be advisable to install also LFS:

```
git lfs install
```
