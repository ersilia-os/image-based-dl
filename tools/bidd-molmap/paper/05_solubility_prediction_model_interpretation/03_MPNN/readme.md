## the example of MPNN prediction ESOL is here:https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/examples/delaney/delaney_MPNN.py,  but we use the same hyper-params that MoleculeNet has been optimized, namly this "delaneympnn.pkl" file, which is extracted from http://deepchem.io.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/trained_models/Hyperparameter_MoleculeNetv3.tar.gz

```json

{'nb_epoch': 50,
 'M': 2,
 'batch_size': 32,
 'seed': 123,
 'T': 1,
 'learning_rate': 0.003183415042748088}

```


## use the same train,valid, test, etc dataset as other models
