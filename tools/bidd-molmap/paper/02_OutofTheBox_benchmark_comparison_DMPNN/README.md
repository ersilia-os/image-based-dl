# In this Section, we compare our molmap model with the graph-based model: D-MPNN from [Yang et al's work] (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00237) 


The benchmark datasets are used, and the details about the data split is here: https://github.com/shenwanxiang/ChemBench. The split method are the same with the orignal MoleculeNet from ['Wu et al's work](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c7sc02664a#!divAbstract)
